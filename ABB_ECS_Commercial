Commercial Risk Assessment: ABB ECS Procurement for Absheron Ph2 CPF Project

1. Executive Context and Contractual Foundation

This memorandum provides a strategic commercial risk assessment of the USD 770,000 budgetary offer from ABB Korea for the Electrical Control System (ECS) serving the Absheron Ph2 CPF Project. The ECS represents a high-dependency technological core of the project; however, the current proposal is governed by a framework that aggressively protects the Supplier while leaving the Customer (HEC) with substantial exposure.

Per the "Important Notice" in ABB Quotation 20683340, the offer is "preliminary and non-binding," serving only as a basis for discussion. This designation grants ABB the unilateral discretion to alter price, schedule, and scope prior to formal contract execution, injecting significant budgetary uncertainty into the project's early phases. Crucially, while the offer originates from ABB Korea, Clause 24 of the ABB GTC 2025-3 stipulates that the English version of the agreement prevails in the event of any discrepancy—a vital legal distinction for HEC’s counsel to maintain during local negotiations.

The core commercial parameters are summarized below:

Parameter	Detail
Total Value	USD 770,000.00 (VAT Excluded)
Delivery Terms	FCA Dilovası Factory, Turkey (Incoterms 2020)
Payment Terms	60 days net from invoice date
Delivery Lead Time	9 Months after contract issuance
Governing Framework	ORGALIME S 2000 and ABB GTC 2025-3 (Prevailing)

The following analysis details how these parameters, combined with the ABB GTC, create a liability landscape heavily weighted in favor of the Supplier.

2. Analysis of the ‘Excusable Event’ and Price Escalation Framework

In the current climate of semiconductor scarcity and raw material volatility, ABB has constructed a "double-threat" mechanism via Clauses 26 and 27 that effectively eliminates the concept of a fixed-price agreement.

* The "Excusable Event" (Clause 26): ABB broadly defines Excusable Events to include "global severe shortage of electronic components" and "market volatility." This classification shifts the entirety of supply chain risk to HEC.
* Price Escalation (Clause 27): Independent of specific "Excusable Events," Clause 27 allows ABB to adjust the contract price based on the "current prices" of parts and raw materials. This grants ABB the right to pass through unanticipated cost increases simply by notifying the Customer, effectively converting the Purchase Order (PO) into a cost-plus arrangement.

Remedies and Strategic Impact: Under an Excusable Event, ABB claims three primary remedies that allow for unilateral contract modification:

1. Reasonable Time Extensions: ABB is relieved of delivery obligations, neutralizing Liquidated Damages.
2. Equitable Price Adjustments: HEC must compensate ABB for documented increases in transport or component costs.
3. Quantity Reductions: ABB may reduce the delivered quantity to ensure partial fulfillment, potentially leaving the CPF project with an incomplete control system.

So What? These clauses allow ABB to reset the commercial baseline at will. Clause 26.3 further mandates that HEC waives all claims for damages or termination arising from these delays, locking the project into a volatile cost structure.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. Financial Liability and Indemnification Limits (Clause 12)

Clause 12 establishes a rigid ceiling on ABB's financial exposure, creating a "catastrophic risk gap" for the project.

* Aggregate Liability Cap (Clause 12.1): Total liability is strictly restricted to the PO price of USD 770,000. This ceiling applies even during the 18-month warranty period. If a system failure during the warranty period necessitates a total replacement including logistics and onsite labor—costs that could easily double the original price—HEC’s recovery is legally capped at the original $770k.
* Exclusion of Consequential Damages (Clause 12.2): ABB is exempted from all indirect or consequential losses. HEC faces unmitigated exposure for:
  * Loss of profit and revenue.
  * Downtime costs and increased operating costs.
  * Loss of anticipated savings.

Given the ECS’s role in power infrastructure, any failure results in massive operational downtime. Clause 12.2 ensures ABB remains insulated from these high-value project risks, regardless of fault.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. Termination Mechanics and Penalty Structures (Clause 13)

The termination framework is designed to secure 100% of the contract value almost immediately after PO issuance. Clause 13.1 prohibits "Termination for Convenience," and the associated penalty schedule functions as a Liquidated Damage for Termination, where ABB need not prove actual loss to claim the fee.

Termination Timing	Penalty Percentage	USD Exposure
< 7 Days from PO	65%	$500,500
7 Days to 1 Month	90%	$693,000
> 1 Month	100%	$770,000

Strategic Implications: After only 30 days, HEC is financially committed to the full contract value. Furthermore, ABB reserves the right to terminate for "Material Breach" (Clause 13.2) if HEC resells the goods to an unapproved end-user or fails to proceed with follow-up measures for 12 months, highlighting the need for absolute end-user alignment.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. Delivery, Delay, and Performance Safeguards

The interaction between the delivery location and the "Acceptance" logic creates a significant logistical trap for HEC.

* The Geography Risk (Clause 6.1): Delivery is FCA Dilovası (Turkey). Clause 6.1 dictates a 10-day (calendar) "Deemed Accepted" window starting upon completion of delivery. Because the 10-day clock begins at the factory in Turkey, the goods will almost certainly be "deemed accepted" while still in transit or customs before ever reaching the Azerbaijan project site. HEC loses its right to reject non-conforming goods before they can be inspected.
* Liquidated Damages (Clause 7): Delay LDs are set at 0.1% per day, capped at 5% ($38,500). Clause 7.2 defines this as the "sole and exclusive remedy," meaning once the 50-day delay threshold is reached, HEC has no further financial recourse for continued delays that may stall the entire Ph2 CPF Project.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. Scope Boundaries and Integration Risks

Technical Architecture document 70-10-61-0001 contains "Notes" that fragment responsibility for the network's integrity and create commercial scope gaps.

* Note 1: Explicitly excludes Ethernet switches, fiber equipment, patch panels, and switchgear-to-switchgear fiber cables from ABB’s scope.
* Note 2: Excludes any integration to external systems.

Commercial Risk Analysis: These exclusions guarantee a scope gap that necessitates HEC procuring critical networking hardware from third parties. This fragments responsibility; if the ECS fails to communicate with the broader network, ABB can deflect liability toward "out of scope" components. This fragmentation necessitates complex multi-vendor coordination and invites unforeseen integration costs and schedule slips.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. Strategic Risk Mitigation Summary

The ABB ECS offer is characterized by high price volatility, an aggressive 100% termination lock-in, and a 5% LD cap that is insufficient for the project's scale.

To align this procurement with the project's risk tolerance, negotiations must prioritize the following:

* Milestone-Based Termination: Replace the time-based penalty with a milestone schedule: 20% upon Submittal Approval, 40% upon Material Procurement, 60% upon Assembly, and 80% upon FAT.
* Acceptance Period: Negotiate the 10-day "Deemed Accepted" window to trigger only upon arrival at the Project Site in Azerbaijan, rather than the factory in Turkey.
* Price Adjustment Triggers: Restrict Clause 27 by requiring transparent, "open-book" documentation and setting a minimum "volatility threshold" (e.g., 10% price change) before an adjustment can be triggered.
* Scope Realignment: Insist on the inclusion of "Note 1" networking hardware into the ABB scope to ensure single-point responsibility for system communication.
